    "## The problem\n",
    "Application developers often find themselves in a situation where they have to pre-process relatively static input files.  This processing can often be time consuming due to the size of the input file and/or the complexity of the processing task itself.  As such, it often makes sense to preserve the output of the process, repeating it only when:\n",
    "* The contents of the input file changes\n",
    "* The input parameters to the process change\n",
    "* The process algorithm itself changes\n",
    "\n",
    "## One solution\n",
    "`cachejar` is designed to provide a generic solution to this problem. Given:\n",
    "* An application identifier\n",
    "* A uri, file name\n",
    "* An object identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "`cachejar` can determine whether processing is necessary and, if not, can return an image of an object that corresponds to the supplied parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is up to the software developer to determine what constitutes an \"application identifier\" -- typically one might use a combination of a package name and a version identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "`cachejar` includes two global objects:\n",
    "1. `factory` - a default instance of `CacheFactory` that keeps track of the caches for individual application versions.  By default, `cachjar` caches are located in the OS equivalent of the path: `~/.cachejar`.  The cache itself is organized as:\n",
    "```text\n",
    ".cachejar\n",
    "    |\n",
    "    + <application id 1>\n",
    "    |       |\n",
    "    |       + index -- A map that associates URI or file name, its size and modification time\n",
    "    |       |           with a list of object identifier to file names\n",
    "    |       |\n",
    "    |       + Axxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx - pickled object 1\n",
    "    |       |\n",
    "    |       + Axxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx - pickled object 2\n",
    "    |       |\n",
    "    |       + ...\n",
    "    |\n",
    "    + <application id 2>\n",
    "            |\n",
    "            + ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. `jar` - a function that returns returns a `CacheJar` object for a given application id. It is not necessary to persist the returned object, as it can be re-fetched whenever needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we hava a class (`MyClass`) that does some sort of processing on a named file or uri, based on the 'forward' parameter.  For this example, we just tweak the file name, but in real life the processing would most likely be done on the file or URI itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also defined an input processor that returns an instance of `MyClass` using the parameters. It first checks the cache and, if not found, constructs an actual instance.\n"
